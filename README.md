# EDA_ON_COVID
I did this project as part of learning data analysis with Python. I had to find a dataset and perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) on it. So, without much thought i decided to work with the Covid-19. I downloaded the dataset from (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). This gave a complete info about the countries and their Covid data starting from Feb 22-2020 to today(i did this with different date but when you download it will be latest).


Similarly i downloaded another data set from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-worldfor) for the basic information of countries(not covid related). I wanted to combine datasets for my analysis and better understanding so that i can group them and try to understand correlations of data.


For this i project i have used **Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn**


Pandas is a python library that contains data structures and data manipulation tools.
Matplotlib is a python plotting library used for plotting of data(bars, lines, scatter, box, heat).
Seaborn is also a python library which provides tools which provide the visualisation and describe the distribution .
